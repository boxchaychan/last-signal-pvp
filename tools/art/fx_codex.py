# Skill / attack effects for the action game, made by Codex (owner 2026-11-09 "มีเอฟเฟคที่อยากได้ไหม"). One picture per
# effect: 6 frames in a 3x2 grid of 512 px cells. Seen from the game's camera: low top-down, so things lying on the
# ground are flat ellipses. Owner 2026-11-09 sent a clip of a 2D MMO's sword class ("อยากได้สกิลประมาณนี้ สีสันจะออกสด"):
# the look, not the skills, is taken: bold black ink-brush strokes splashed with ONE vivid accent colour, white-hot
# flashes, petals / sparks, big and dramatic. Black ink cannot survive a black background, so from then on the pictures
# are on PURE GREEN (#00FF00) and keyed out (the first one, fireball, was done on black).
#   python tools/art/fx_codex.py       -> docs/codex/action/FX.md (queue + full prompts; keeps rows marked done)

## Rules
- ONE picture per row: one effect, 6 frames in a 3x2 grid on PURE GREEN #00FF00 (the game keys the green out; the style
  uses black ink strokes, so the background can no longer be black). Fireball (row 1) was done on black: keep it.
  No reference picture is needed.
- Save full size as `art/incoming/fx_codex/<key>.png`; one Thai line per file in `art/incoming/fx_codex/REPORT_TH.txt`.
- Mark the row `done` here. Work in the order of the queue; "ทำเอฟเฟคต่อ" = continue at the first `todo`.
- Branch `codex/fx`, commit, never merge, never push to `main`. Claude works in this same folder on `main`: when you stop,
  switch the folder back with `git checkout main`.
