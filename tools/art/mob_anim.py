# Animation frames for the action-game monsters, made by Codex (owner 2026-11-09 "เฟรมเจนเอา ให้ codex ทำ"; monsters are
# NOT made in PixelLab). One picture per monster per action: 6 frames in a 3x2 grid of 512 px cells on white, side view
# facing right (the game mirrors it for the left), the monster's own turnaround attached. Same recipe that worked for the
# legends (one action per picture, "every frame a clearly DIFFERENT pose", "Do ONLY this one picture now").

Owner 2026-11-09: the monsters' frames are made by Codex (not PixelLab). Reply to the owner in Thai, short and plain.

## Rules
- ONE picture per row of the queue: one monster, one action, 6 frames in a 3x2 grid on white. Attach the monster's own
  turnaround `art/incoming/mobs/<key>.png` every time (it is the reference for face, colours and size).
- Save full size as `art/incoming/mobs/anim/<key>_<action>.png`; add one Thai line per file to
  `art/incoming/mobs/anim/REPORT_TH.txt` (anything that came out wrong: a frame crossing a cell, a turned view, a missing frame).
- Mark the row `done` here. Work in the order of the queue; when the owner says "ทำเฟรมมอนต่อ", continue at the first `todo`.
- Branch `codex/mob-anim`, open a pull request, never merge, never push to `main`. Claude works in this same folder on
  `main`: when you stop, switch the folder back with `git checkout main` so the other agent's work does not land on your branch.
